        <p>You and only you are responsible for your security.</p>
        <p>The handling of your keys happens entirely on your computer, inside your browser.</p>
        <p>We never transmit, receive or store your private key, password, or other account information.</p>
        <p>If you send your public key (address) to someone, they can send you ETH or tokens.</p>
